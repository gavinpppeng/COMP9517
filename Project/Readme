Analysing pedestrians (or humans) in videos is one of the most common applications of Computer Vision. 
A wide range of practical scenarios ranging from simple domestic surveillance to self-driving cars thrive on the success of pedestrian detection, 
tracking and advanced analysis of motion. Many well-established computer vision techniques in conjunction with machine learning techniques are useful in this task. 
These may include image / video pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, motion detection, tracking and recognition, and also deep-CNN algorithms.
